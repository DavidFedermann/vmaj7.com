                        <strong>On "Kind Of Blue" the solos are improvised.</strong>
                        <br/>
                        The legend has it that a single take was enough for the 5 tracks of the album.
                        Miles, Coltrane, Adderley and Evans improvised furiously on that day, the 2nd March 1959, but as they were recorded, their work took on a special importance.

                        Their solos will one day become as well known as a song's lyrics, impossible to change (to such a point that scores would be published 10 or 20 years later by editors  who have re-written the solos note for note, having had the luxury of playing the tape in slow motion!)

                        When he is not at home, stucked to his stereo, he goes to clubs to see jazzmen playing live. The notes that he hears strike a chord but disappear as soon as they have been played. Of course, it's touching to listen to a musician who is living the moment and to try and catch the fragile thing he's creating.
                        <br/>
                        But it is just as touching to tape this jazzman because what he's improvising will be available for listening for ever.
                        <br/>
                        So either we record it or our brave publisher is in the room to write down that Be-Bop solo !!!
                        <br/>
                        The fact of recording the music on a tape is magical and that's the choice the boy makes because he's never going to learn how to read music.

                        Jazz records always used to be played "live" - a reflection of what happens in clubs.
                        <br/>
                        It's only much later tha Jazz would try studio tricks whereas pop music completly gave itself to it centuries ago.
                        <br/>
                        By entering a studio, a single flutist becomes an orchestra !
                        <br/>
                        It is as if the jazzmen were frightened of losing the essence of their music by manipulating their recordings - like a sacrilege - while Jazz was looking to go elsewhere.

                <p class="text--center">
                    The single-take-legend was almost true because in 1997 (almost 40 years later), Columbia released an alternative take of "Flamenco Sketches", the fifth track of the album.
                    <br/>
                    We can easily imagine that the unquestionable influence of "Kind of Blue" on music history would have been different if Miles Davis and producer Teo Macero had chosen the alternative take as the one to be released.
